# NYU CSCI-UA 201 Computer Systems Organization

## [Lab #1(clab-part1): Basic C Programming](https://github.com/seoeunHong/CSCI-UA-201/tree/main/Lab1)

Learning some basic C programming by writing down simple C functions and debugging.

## [Lab 2 (clab-part2): Basic C Programming](https://github.com/seoeunHong/CSCI-UA-201/tree/main/Lab2)

Continue learning some basic C programming by writing a few C functions manipulating strings, and a hash table which can be used to lookup keys in O(1) time.

## [Lab 3: Binary Mystery](https://github.com/seoeunHong/CSCI-UA-201/tree/main/Lab3)

Deduce the function based on their x86-64 assembly code and write the corresponding C function that accomplishes the same thing for each of functions.

## [Lab 4: Malloc lab](https://github.com/seoeunHong/CSCI-UA-201/tree/main/Lab4)

Make my own version of the malloc: the dynamic storage allocator for C programs.
Explore the design space creatively and implement an allocator that is correct, efficient and fast.
